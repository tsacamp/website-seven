<h1>what is a dinosaur</h1>

<p>A dinosaur were very cool a nd alite bit mysteryious creatures that lived at least 248 million years ago.  there wherer herbvores carnivores and omnivores, herbivores eat plants so they have teeth that are ment for grinding plants which mean that the are flat on the top with little ridged on the top too.  a carnivore is a animal that has tees that are very sharp and serrated on the sides which are meant for ripping up meat from their prey.  Aomnivore are animals like us that eat plants and meat so they have both types of teeth.  there were differnt time periods that dinosaurs lived in there was the Mesozoic Era,  the Triassic period, the Jurassic period then the Cretaceous period.  The dinosaur that we are talking about the Tyranousaurous Rex, lived in the late cretaceous period so about 65 million yeas ago.</p>

<h2>where did the T-Rex live?</h2>

<p>the T-Rex lived on earth, during the late cretaceous period.  it would only live for about 30 years so not very long.  its habitat was pretty warm and he would live around where his prey or the dinosaurs that he likes to eat roam around and it would make it easierto hunt becasue they were in the same area as him</p>

<h3>what did the T-Rex eat?</h3>

<p>The T-Rex was a carnivore which means it likes to eat meat.  The T-Rex would eat what ever it wanted.  some of the dinosaurs that were on his menu were the triceratops, the santanaraptor, the corythosaurus, the edmontosaurus and suprisingly each other.  One of the most commmon dinosaurs that the T-rex liked to eat was the Triceratops, thast was the most comoun dinosaur that most people say.</p>

<h4> where did the Dinosaurs disapear to?</h4>

<p>The T-REx didn ot just dissaperar almost all of the dinosaurs did to when a giant meteor colided with the earth and it caused a mass extinction of the dinosaurs, and that was the end of the cretaceous period.  the only aniumals that survived the extingtion were the birds and some reptiless that evolved to the birds and reptiles we know today.  the reason why  most of the dinosaurs besides the birds and some reptiles went extinct becasue all of the smoke from the wild fires blocked out the sun and caused the plants amd trees to die bwecasue they need the sun to live, since the plants died that means that the dinosaurs that ate the plants (or herbvores) had nothing to eat sot they died.  this means that the carnivores (dinosaurs that eat meat) have nothing to to eat becasue all of their prey died, they ate other carnivores to but they died becasue they had nothing to eat.  The animals that survived either like mamals, lived under ground.  animals like birds lived in a place where the effect from the meteor wasa lot lessbad, of for reptiles like crocdiles would live under water
